# Spotify-Sentiment-Analysis
This was my final project in my Machine Learning class. It is a sentiment analysis that takes my top songs on Spotify and assigns them a score of 0 or 1 (0 being more negative in sentiment and 1 being more positive). The results of the ML model are compared to the results of Spotify's valence score which is a 'measure of a song's positiveness' as well as the self-assigned labels I manually gave each songs. The 3 scores are compared side by side.
